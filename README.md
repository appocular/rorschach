# Rorschach

The important env vars is:
`CIRCLE_SHA1`
`APPOCULAR_TOKEN`
`RORSCHACH_HISTORY`

## Usage

To use, add something along these lines to the Circle configuration:

``` shell
wget https://github.com/appocular/rorschach/releases/download/0.2.0/rorschach.phar
php rorschach.phar
```

## Environment variables

- `CIRCLE_SHA1`: Used to get the SHA of the commit being tested.
- `APPOCULAR_TOKEN`: Repository token. So Appocular can find the right
  repository to put images.
- `RORSCHACH_HISTORY`: Overrides the history from git. Primarily for
  testing, but might be useful in special cases. A newline separated
  list of commit SHAs. `git rev-list HEAD` produces the same history
  as Rorschach produces per default.


## Options

- `--webdriver`: URL of WebDriver. Overrides `rorschach.yml`.
- `--base-url`: Base URL of site. Overrides `rorschach.yml`.
- `--write-out`: Don't send images to Appocular, but write to the
  given directory. Primarily for testing.
- `--read-in`: Don't use WebDriver, but use images in the given
  directory, previously created by `--write-out`. Primarily for
  testing.
- `--base`: Override base URL of Appocular. Primarily for testing.
- `-q`: Quiet. Less output.
